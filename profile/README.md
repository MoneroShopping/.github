# [Monero.Shopping](https://monero.shopping) - Spend Monero anywhere!

## Lets face it!
You wont be able to use Monero on Amazon, Ebay or Wish anytime soon.

We should not hope for the Vendors to realize the importance of privacy and the awesomeness of Monero.

Lets instead enable everyone to buy and use Monero as easy as possible!

## The Idea
#### Shopping with Monero
A service that brings Monero one step closer to widespread adoption by enabling everyone to use Monero anywhere on the internet.
Monero.Shopping allows everyone to spend Monero on any marketplace or e-commerce store, while providing an extra layer of privacy!

#### How it works
1. After providing a list of products, the customer will receive a Monero Invoice with the total amount+fees.
2. After payment, the products are ordered by Monero.Shopping and send to the customer.
3. The customer is provided with all tracking numbers.

#### Shopping privacy
- This service also adds a privacy layer to the Customers shopping habits and reduces the exposure to surveillance and data collection, implemented by most Vendors, Payment Processors and analytics software.
- Like a VPN for Online-Shopping. 
- No need for register with every marketplace/vendor

## The Goal
We are hereby asking to be accepted into the Community Crowdfunding System.
Our goal is to raise a total of:
#### 975 XMR in 12 Monthly Milestones.

This will cover the monthly operation cost, get the project "off the ground" and allow our team to "live the dream" and focus fully on this project for the next 12 Months = scale, optimize and market the service.

Along with Ease of use and Privacy, Profitability is a main focus, we would like to make the service self-sustaining without further need for community funding by the end of this campaign.

All progress will be documented.

## How the funds will be used:
##### Major Development:
- Reduce order fees and operation cost by automating the invoicing and order process
- Develop Browser Plugin
- Implement Escrow
- Allow returns
- Allow monero purchase via fiat

##### Minor Development:
- Translation
- Documentation
- UI/UX optimizations

##### Marketing:
- video ads
- influencer outreach

## The Team
Our newly formed and purpose oriented team consist of Monero-Bros, Cyberphreaks and Dreamers from Europe, the US, Asia and India.
Privacy, Simplicity, Autonomy and Profit is what drives us and what brought us to Monero!

## Addendum
Milestones are subject to change, some Development will take longer or quicker then expacted.
All progress will be documented.
